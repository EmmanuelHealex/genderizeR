Authors@R: c(person("Kamil", "Wais", email = "kamil.wais@gmail.com", role =
    c("aut", "cre")), person("Nathan", "VanHoudnos", role = "ctb"), person("John", "Ramey", role = "ctb"))
Description: Utilizes the 'genderize.io' API to predict gender from first
    names extracted from a text vector. The accuracy of prediction could be
    controlled by two parameters: counts of a first name in the database and
    probability of prediction.
